Windswept Description

Overhauling Minecraft's clouds, making them look more appealing and adding more depth in the Clouds.
This will be done by making them more thick, more fluffy, more layers and especially more Cloud Types!!

Also adding a wind system that will add some small visuals. And clouds that react to the wind.

All just for you! No server install needed!
