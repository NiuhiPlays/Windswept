Just a list of things I want to do, or have done, for the mod.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shit I need to do:

// Clouds Shit

//ToDo - Make New Cloud Renderer
//ToDo - Make Good looking Cloud
//ToDo - Add a singular cloud type, while making adding more easy (Making sure Types react to how the clouds look)
//ToDo - Make Clouds react to Wind
//ToDo - Make Clouds react to Mountains
//ToDo - Add a few more clouds
//ToDo - Make Clouds react to Environment

// Water Shit

//ToDo - Water Particles, like Effective / Particular & Tidal
    Wakes

//ToDo - Entity Splashes
    Currently only spawn on surface water, rework water detection, maybe mixin?
    Part of the splash spawns underwater
    Particle age should be look at more, at high velocities it lasts a bit to long

//ToDo - Make Waves and Splashes work
    Waves need some Rework
        Add waves coming onto the shore from further away
        Add Better Edge detection so we don't have floating waves in corners etc
        Make waves curve into waves next to them when they spawn diagonal
        Better Rotation animation.
            Move the texture upward in rotation so the texture doesn't stick into the water

// Settings & Overall stuff

//ToDo - Overhaul settings
    Make Wind configurable
        Strength
        Direction
    Make Cloud Looks configurable
    Make All particles Configurable
        Enabling
        Size (Of some)

        Volume
        Enabling

//ToDo - Rework Particle Culling

//ToDo - Make area detection on particles much less resource intensive
    They now produce a lot of lagg when trying to make the particle radius bigger than 16/32 blocks.

//ToDo - Make Own Wind Particle Textures
        Soft wind
        Medium wind
        Strong wind

    Overhaul system yet again.
        System Choices
            Dynamic Wind
            Static Biome Wind
        Fix Dynamic Wind?
        Currently doesn't work like intended.

//ToDo - Make foliage react to wind
        Might need to animate foliage
    Grass
    Flowers

// Entity & Player Particles stuff

//ToDo - Player particles
    Footsteps (Also Animals & Mobs)
        Leaves
        Wet Footprint (Change Texture look & add biome color instead)

    Locked to Cardinal Direction, doesn't follow player
//DONE - Add Wind
    Cardinal Wind Directions, changes per Day
//DONE - Make Some particles react to the Wind
    Leaves
    Smoke

//DONE- Make Wind
    Add 3 wind speeds
    Biome based Wind Speeds
    Storm Wind (Replaces Heavy Wind, but not removing)

//DONE- Water Particles, like Effective / Particular
    Waterfall / Cascades
    Item/Entity - Ripples
    Tides/ waves
    Splashes
    Entity Splashes

//DONE - Player particles
    Footsteps (Also Animals & Mobs)

        Snow
        Wet
        Sand
        Muddy
        Red Sand
    Running
    Also should add light checks, footprints in dark areas now very visible

//DONE - Make Particles render through water
    Fixed because of the Old Culling System

//DONE - Add Sounds (Sound system still needs some overhaul work.)
    Wind
        Different sounds for different wind strengths
    Water
        Cascades

//DONE - Make Own Wind Particle Textures
    Temp Solution used - Scaled based on Wind Type

//DONE - Particle Lighting fixed

//DONE - Make Waves and Splashes work
        It now spawns really easily, even simple water blocks against a block.
            Should only work with Large body of water
        Better Cliff Detection
        Add scale detection, make them bigger on larger bodies of water and large cliffs
            Make them smaller on cascades & tiny cliffs and small bodies of water
        Add Edge detection
        Make waves react to light level, when its dark they are very visible
    Splashes now work on Entities falling into the water to create splashes.
        Might want to change these splashes to work with the Waves instead.
